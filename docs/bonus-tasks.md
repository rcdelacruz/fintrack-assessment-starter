# FinTrack Assessment Bonus Tasks

The following bonus tasks are optional but allow you to demonstrate additional skills beyond the core requirements. Consider implementing one or more of these if you have time after completing the essential features.

## 1. Containerization (Docker)

Create Docker containers for both the frontend and backend applications, enabling easy setup and deployment.

### Requirements:

- Provide a `Dockerfile` for both the frontend and backend services
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run the entire application stack, including MongoDB
- Optimize Docker images for production (multi-stage builds, proper caching, etc.)
- Document container-specific configuration or environment variables
- Ensure proper networking between containers

### Deliverables:

- Docker configuration files
- Documentation on how to build and run the containers
- Notes on any optimizations or security considerations implemented

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment.

### Requirements:

- Create GitHub Actions workflows for the frontend and backend
- Configure automated testing for both applications
- Implement build processes for production assets
- Add linting and code quality checks
- (Optional) Configure automated deployment to a platform of your choice

### Deliverables:

- GitHub Actions workflow configuration files (`.github/workflows/`)
- Documentation on the CI/CD process
- An explanation of why you chose specific CI/CD strategies

## 3. Advanced Authentication

Enhance the authentication system with additional security features.

### Requirements:

- Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- Add options for password reset
- Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
- Add proper input validation and security headers
- (Optional) Implement two-factor authentication

### Deliverables:

- Enhanced authentication endpoints and middleware
- Updated frontend authentication flow
- Documentation on the security improvements made

## 4. Comprehensive Testing

Implement a thorough testing strategy for both frontend and backend.

### Requirements:

- Write unit tests for critical components and functions
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Add end-to-end tests for key user flows
- Configure test coverage reporting
- Document your testing approach and tools

### Deliverables:

- Comprehensive test suites for frontend and backend
- Test coverage reports
- Documentation on testing strategy and approach

## 5. Real-time Features

Add real-time capabilities to the application using WebSockets.

### Requirements:

- Implement WebSocket connection using Socket.io or a similar library
- Add real-time updates for transaction data
- Implement notifications for goal progress or allocation events
- Ensure proper connection management and error handling

### Deliverables:

- WebSocket implementation in both frontend and backend
- Documentation on the real-time architecture
- Example of how real-time events are handled

## Evaluation

Bonus tasks will be evaluated based on:

1. **Implementation Quality**: How well the feature is implemented
2. **Integration**: How seamlessly it integrates with the core application
3. **Documentation**: How clearly you explain what you did and why
4. **Creativity**: Any innovative approaches or solutions

Remember that it's better to implement one bonus task well than to attempt multiple tasks with superficial implementations. Choose the areas that best showcase your strengths and interests.
